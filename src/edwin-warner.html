        Here's a picture of Shelter 8:

        Make sure you give that map a good look before leaving.  Shelter 8 isn't on
        Google Maps, but <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/BrUCehbGQyP2">Shelter 9 is</a>,
        so you can use that to get there, and then stop at Shelter 8.  Look on
        the <a href="http://maps.nashville.gov/NashvilleParksFinder/default.htm?parkFeatureID=44">maps.nashville.gov</a>
        map to see how Shelter 8 and 9 relate to one another geographically.

        There's a chimney at this picnic shelter.  I'm going to stack stones and
        cook over the fire that way.  If you have camping pots or pans, please
        bring them.  If you have a camping grill or stove, that'd be great to
        bring, too.  We can divvy up preparation responsibilities there.  The
        prep is part of the fun :).

        In the way of food, I'm going to bring and prepare:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li> Black beans </li>
        <li> Avocados </li>
        <li> Sweet potatoes </li>
        <li> Red bell peppers </li>
        <li> Mushrooms </li>
        <li> Brussel sprouts </li>
        <li> Couscous (maybe) </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>
        Feel free to invite friends, too!  The more, the merrier.  Just let me
        know so I can make sure we have enough food.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you think it'd be interesting, you can bring a musical instrument, toys,
        ideas, or anything you enjoy and think would be cool to share.

        This particular picnic shelter cost $30 to reserve.  I'm ok with taking
        on the cost this time around, but if you want to send me some money, I
        definitely won't say no.  In the future I'd like to split up the cost
        of reservation, and I'm curious about what it looks like just to show
        up at places without making a reservation.
