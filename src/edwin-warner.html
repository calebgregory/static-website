      <h1>Edwin Warner Picnic Shelter 8 Again</h1>

      <p>
        I haven't sought out a new spot this week, so I propose we go back to
        the same spot.  I'm going to try not making a reservation this time and
        see what happens.  There are several picnic shelters around Edwin
        Warner, so if someone is already there, we should be able to find
        another shelter.  Worst case scenario, we're sitting in an open field
        sparkled with fireflies and surrounded by forest - not bad!  Drive to
        Picnic Shelter 9 and call me when you get there.  I should be there at
        6.
      </p>

      <p>
        If it's raining, I'll need a ride there because my car shouldn't be on
        wet roads.  It has a damaged inner fender.  Let me know if you're
        willing to give me a ride.  Thanks!
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's a picture of Shelter 8.  It is constructed of stones, shingles,
        concrete, and cedar logs.  It has a chimney and a picnic table.

      <p>
        And here are directions to it:

        </a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Make sure you give that map a good look before leaving.  Shelter 8 isn't on
        Google Maps, but <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/BrUCehbGQyP2">Shelter 9 is</a>,
        so you can use that to get there.  Again, <b>drive to Shelter 9</b> and
        call me when you get there for <i>further instruction</i>.  I'll be nearby.
      </p>

      <h5>What to bring</h5>

      <p>
        Let's BYO Food this week.  That'll make us more flexible if we need to
        find another place to eat.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have a blanket on which to lie, bring it.  Portable furniture
        that helps you relax more comfortably?  Bring it!  Some sort of bug
        repellant?  Brrriiiinnngg ittttt <i>[This is emphasized for dramatic
        effect; the bugs actually weren't that bad last week]</i>.  If you
        have a portable musical instrument and enjoy making vibrations at
        harmonic frequencies in the spaces you dwell, bbbrrrrriiiiiiiiinnnnnggg
        thththaaaaaaaat.  And most importantly, bring your self :}.  ~
      </p>

      <p> Here's a list:  <b>Bring</b> </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Your own food and water</li>
        <li>Source of light (headlamp, flashlight, lantern)</li>
        <li>Something to comfortably lie or sit in (blanket, chair, hammock)</li>
        <li>Something to play with (musical instrument, toy, words and ideas, or simply a special flavor of somethingness, if that's your thing)</li>
        <li>Bug repellant (*_^)_b</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Lastly,</h5>
