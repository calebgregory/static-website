      <h1>Picnic at a picnic table off Highway 100</h1>

      <p>
        The past couple of weeks, as we've been driving to Edwin Warner, I have
        noticed a large pond along Highway 100 I pass on the way there.  There
        are two picnic tables there, one on each side of the lake.  Both weeks,
        there have been people parked on the side of the road, with fish poles
        and tanktops, having an evening.  Seems like a good place for a picnic
        to me.
      </p>

      <p>
      <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/9H4swcaftaq">Here's the picnic table (in the
        very center of this image)</a>.  Look at <a
        href="https://goo.gl/maps/KsoCDbCtuj62">this map</a>.  It will take you
        "Cheekwood Child Development"...  Despite the potential deeply symbolic
        meaning here, don't stop there.  Keep going.  You'll go to the pond you
        see on the map, just after Cheekwood Child Development, park on the
        street, and see me at one of those picnic tables.
      </p>

        Possible unfortunate scenario:  it rains and we have no shelter.  But I
        don't think it's supposed to rain in the evening tomorrow.  If it
        <i>does</i> and you were wanting to come, call me before you leave and
        we'll go from there.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Just thought of another possibility!</b>  There is a cave nearby we
        can crawl into.  I've been wanting to take some instruments in there
        and bounce sounds off the cave walls.  Definitely bring a headlamp or
        flashlight so that you can see in the cave.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's a picture of the mouth of this cave from January.  Thanks be unto
        Mike for introducing me to this place!
      </p>

      <p>
        For <i>next week</i>, I propose we consider going to <a
          href="http://www.percy-priest-lake.com/cook-day-use-area/">The Percy
          Priest Lake "Cook Day Use Area"</a> (yes, that is the official
        title).  It seems like a pleasant place, and even if we don't use the
        pavilions they have there, there's a <a
          href="https://www.google.com/maps/uv?hl=en&pb=!1s0x88646b5bea658ef3%3A0xbbad8371adabaacf!2m22!2m2!1i80!2i80!3m1!2i20!16m16!1b1!2m2!1m1!1e1!2m2!1m1!1e3!2m2!1m1!1e5!2m2!1m1!1e4!2m2!1m1!1e6!3m1!7e115!4shttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.recreation.gov%2Fcamping%2Fcook-day-use-area%2Fr%2FcampgroundDetails.do%3FcontractCode%3DNRSO%26parkId%3D71098!5spicnic%20shelter%2C%20near%20me%20-%20Google%20Search&imagekey=!1e10!2sAF1QipORF-AsuEpEl14nHoMk3ejtMD_7kBIbC-XBxstO">beach
          and some trails</a> we could bum around on.  I'd want to go earlier
        in the mid-afternoon to swim.  We could grace the other people there
        with our songs, as well.
      </p>

      <h5>What to bring</h5>

      <p>
        Let's BYO Food again this week.  I'll cook again, one of these days.
        Maybe next week.  I'm primarily trying to survive the next two weeks of
        work before I'm unemployed.  <i>So that's where I'm at.</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have a blanket on which to lie, bring it.  Portable furniture
        that helps you relax more comfortably?  Bring it!  Some sort of bug
        repellant?  Brrriiiinnngg ittttt.  If you have a portable musical
        instrument and enjoy making vibrations at harmonic frequencies in the
        spaces you dwell, bbbrrrrriiiiiiiiinnnnnggg thththaaaaaaaat.  Bring
        clothes you don't mind getting muddy, also, so we can go into that cave
        with no mixed feelings.  And most importantly, bring your self :}.  ~
      </p>

      <p> Here's a list:  <b>Bring</b> </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Your own food and water</li>
        <li>Source of light (headlamp, flashlight, lantern)</li>
        <li>Clothes you can go into a somewhat muddy cave wearing</li>
        <li>Something to comfortably lie or sit in (blanket, chair, hammock)</li>
        <li>Something to play with (musical instrument, toy, words and ideas, or simply a special flavor of somethingness, if that's your thing)</li>
        <li>Bug repellant (*_^)_b</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Lastly,</h5>

      <p>
        I'll post updates below, so check this page before you leave on Sunday.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="color: tomato"><b>Canceled!</b></span> It's raining, so
